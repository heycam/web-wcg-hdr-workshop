            <dd><details><summary>Keeping W3C Relevant in an HDR / WCG Living Room Environment</summary>
              <p>Next generation multimedia formats such as HDR are being rapidly adopted in the Living Room Environment as consumers continue to upgrade their devices. This pace of adoption has outpaced our ability as an industry to define standardized and interoperable methods of handling these new formats leading to custom solutions and the fragmentation of the HTML ecosystem in this environment. In this talk we discuss the uniqueness of the Living Room Environment and aim to prompt a discussion on the best way for the W3C to re-engage and once again lead innovation in this environment.</p></details>

                <p>The presentation will provide an overview of the HLG HDR system. It will show how HLG, as it is based on relative "scene-light", is well matched to the human visual system. The presentation will go on to explain how the HLG signal can be shown on a wide range of different brightness displays in different viewing environments, whilst preserving its appearance - particularly important for laptops, PCs and mobile phones.</p></details>

            <dd><details><summary>How to Enable HDR Mode on Your HDR Compatible Monitor under Windows OS?</summary>
              <p>Nowadays HDR compatible monitor is commonly available in the market, but very often, it is not possible to enable the HDR mode on the monitor in a desktop environment. In the talk, we will show you how to enable the HDR mode under Windows 10, so you could truly experience the benefit of HDR monitor without using a Blu-ray player. A true 10-bit display workflow versus 8-bit workflow will be compared under HDR curve to see the advantage of utilizing the 10-bit workflow. Although this is not as technical as the workshop proposed topics, I do believe this is an important topic to be discussed. There is no comprehensive source of information which delivers this kind of hands-on knowledge.</p></details>

            <p>This talk will provide an overview of how color is handled and manipulated by the Chromium browser to paint different kinds of Web components, followed by a discussion of the changes that would be necessary in order to implement support for richer, higher-precision colors.</p></details>

            <p>Discusses the implementation experience of expanding color space support in WebKit culminating in CSS Color 4 support for non-sRGB colors, and how that experience shaped my opinions on what needs to evolve in the web standards around color.</p></details>

              <summary>Better than Lab? Gamut reduction CIE Lab &amp; OKLab</summary>
            <p>Colors which are outside the gamut of the display device need to be mapped so that they are within the gamut. Although an industry standard for decades, CIE Lab is known to exhibit limitations such as over-estimating color difference with high-chroma colors (even with deltaE 2000), and a hue non-linearity in the blue-purple region. This talk reports on investigation of a newer opponent color space for gamut reduction of individual colors. This will inform browser implementations of gamut reduction, particularly if ICC profiles are not being used.</p></details>

            <p>The Web platform is in dire need of a Color object, and it needs to be well designed and intuitive to use. It needs to support all the color formats and color spaces of CSS Color, HDR, conversion between color spaces, color adjustment in any color space, interpolation, gamut mapping, contrast calculation, among other things.</p>
            <p>The sheer breadth of use cases means that this poses unique API design challenges. I took a stab at these challenges while co-developing a color library with Chris Lilley, Color.js. This presentation will describe some of the API design dilemmas that we faced while developing this library and the design decisions we made.</p></details>

          <dd><details><summary>An Introduction to Hybrid Log-Gamma HDR Part 2: Format conversion and compositing</summary>
            <p>The presentation will provide an overview of the HLG HDR system. It will illustrate how to composite SDR (sRGB) and HLG HDR content side-by-side, and show how the backwards compatible nature of the HLG signal allows it to be shown on SDR screens of different colour gamuts.            </p></details>

            <p>
              HDR pipelines for full-screen content such as movies and video are well established covering all parts of the pipeline such as content production, delivery and display. However, the pipeline elements required to successfully facilitate content that is composited in real-time is still in its infancy. Examples for such composited content are websites or graphical user interfaces that use markup language ‘recipes’ to assemble a set of independent content elements that might be encoded in different HDR and SDR formats into a cohesive presentation, both in SDR and HDR. This talk compares the different requirements and approaches and discusses the aspects that need to be considered to achieve a successful rendering pipeline.

            <p>Preparing HDR content from the user perspective:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>How users are expected to prepare HDR content for web.</li>
                <li>What file formats are supported (in Krita) and what are their limitations.</li>
                <li>ITU BT.2100 PQ EOTF extension for the PNG format. Fallback ICC profile.</li>
                <li>Preparing HDR content while working on SDR hardware</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Technical topics:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>What HDR APIs are available for developers: DirectX supports that. OpenGL-based applications can use it through Google's Angle library.</li>
                <li>Supported surface types.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Technical problems for creator's applications development:</p>
              <p>The standard for displays expects that the display accepts "absolute" bt2020pq colors and shows them on screen using vendor-specific conversions algorithm. It meant that the content creator has no way to color-proof the result. They need to own multiple displays to check that their content "looks good everywhere". That is exactly what ICC technology used to solve, which does not exist in HDR world yet.

        <p>I am a permanent researcher at the color and visual computing laboratory, NTNU. I have pursued my PhD in signal and image processing, at Technicolor and University of Poitiers, in 2016. My thesis was mainly focused on adaptation of SDR contents for new HDR displays. My master's study was also in color in informatics and media technology. After the completion of my PhD, I have been working on several research projects such as enhancement of video conferencing quality, image retargeting, image quality enhancement with deep learning, mobile phone camera characterization for accurate skin color correction, and related others. Generally, my area of expertise include HDR imaging, color imaging and perceptual modeling, as well as computer vision. </p>

        <p>For over a year now, I have been implementing new CSS features in Chromium. This included an initial attempt at implementing the lab() and lch() CSS functions to describe colors in the CIE l*a*b color space. Even though this project proved too broad for a single contributor, it gave me the opportunity to research the Chromium platform as well as the relevant literature, current state of the art, and related standards.</p>

        <p>I've been working with HDR imaging concepts and technologies over the past 15 years. My background is in color science and imaging in general. I've been with Dolby since 2007 and have been involved since then in researching and developing  the core concepts of what is now Dolby Vision. Over the last year, I have been looking into how HDR can be facilitated with canvas based rendering pipelines such as the ones facilitated by the w3c, and how we can use the learnings from linear HDR approaches with web and GUI rendering.</p>

        <p>I hold a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Bristol, UK and a MSc from the University of Freiburg, Germany.
