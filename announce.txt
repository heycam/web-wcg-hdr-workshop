Dear Advisory Committee Representative,
Chairs,

W3C is pleased to call for participation in:

        W3C Workshop on Wide Color Gamut (WCG)
        and High Dynamic Range (HDR) for the Web
        April-May 2021, Virtual Event
        https://www.w3.org/Graphics/Color/Workshop/

The primary goal of the workshop is to bring together browser vendors,
content creators, color scientists, and experts in other relevant areas
(e.g. accessibility, scripting, security, web) to converge on technologies
for enabling WCG and HDR on the Open Web Platform.

The event will be organized as a combination of pre-recorded talks
(expressions of interest are due 30 January, with recorded talks to
be submitted by 15 March 2020) followed by online issue raising on GitHub,
and culminating in a series of live sessions in
April and May, organized around three main themes:
* Wide Color Gamut on the Web
* High Dynamic Range on the Web
* WCG and HDR Standardization Landscape

Attendance is free for all invited participants and is open to the
public, whether or not W3C members.
